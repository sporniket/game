# Sample Game descriptor #
##########################

# Supported canvas size to choose from.
# A game launcher SHOULD :
# * either display the list, allowing to select canvas size that are compatible with the physical screen (windowed or fullscreen)
# * or select automatically a suitable canvas size, e.g. the first compatible or the biggest compatible size.
#
# Each item is defined using the following pattern :
# id ':' width 'x' height
canvas.definitions <<- END
	qHD:960x540
	FHD:1920x1080
END

#### Graphical definition specification ####
# E.g. :
# SD graphics (graphic definition value '1') will be used by default.
# HD graphics (graphic definition value '2') will be used as soon as the width of the canvas will be above 1600 pixels.
# UHD graphics (graphic definition value '3') will be used as soon as the width of the canvas will be above 3200 pixels.
#
# The graphic definition value start from 1, and is incremented for each treshold that is less than the canvas dimension.
#
# axis : 'horizontal', 'vertical', case insensitive.
graphicalDefinitionsSpecs.axis = horizontal
# tresholds : a list of integers (SHOULD be sorted in ascending order for better readability).
graphicalDefinitionsSpecs.tresholds <<- END
	1600
	3200
END
# a map of values depending from the graphical definition.
# format : 
# key:type:value 1, value 2, ...
#
# Each key has a type :
# * word : ascii letters, ascii digits, dot, dash, underscore
# * integer : ascii digits, plus, minus, will be converted into integer values
#
# For each key, each values is mapped to the graphical definition value : the first value is mapped to the
# graphical definition '1', the second one to '2' and so on.
# When there are less values than the number of graphical definitions, the last value is mapped.
graphicalDefinitionsSpecs.dataMap <<- END
	gdef:word:qHD,FHD,UHD
	scaleFactor:integer:1,2,4
	gridSize:integer:40,80,160
	sampleConst:integer:20
END

# Gamelet registry : a list of name->classname
gamelets.registry <<- END
	main:com.sporniket.libre.game.canvas.swing.demo_00.DemoGamelet
END

# Gamelet sequence : the list of gamelets (by name in the registry) to call in sequences
# i.e. the gamelet controler will forward to the first gamelet of the list, then, when this gamelet send a backward event,
# the controler forward to the next, and so on.
# Typically, the sequence will start with various splash screens and will finish with the main menu.
gamelets.sequence <<- END
	main
END

#### Canvas Manager Specifications ####

# list of canvas to initialize, they MUST have a name
# tentative formats :
# * screen sized offscreen : id ':' 'offScreen'
# * arbitrary offscreen : id ':' 'offScreen' ':' width 'x' height
# * image to load : id ':' 'url' ':' path relative to the base url for graphics.
# * image to load among a group : id ':' 'urlList' ':' comma separated urls relative to the base url for graphics.
canvasManagerSpecs.canvasSpecs <<- END
    screen0:offScreen
    screen1:offScreen
    screen2:offScreen
    tileset:url:spritesheet.png
    background:urlList:back01.png, back02.png, ...
    main:offScreen
END

# list of the screen sized canvas names used for the buffering of the screen.
# * 2 items => double buffering
# * 3 items => triple buffering
# Each reference MUST exists in the canvasManagerSpecs.canvasSpecs list.
canvasManagerSpecs.bufferingNames <<- END
	screen0
	screen1
	screen2
END

#### Base urls specifications ####

# Base url for any data file
baseUrlSpecs.baseUrlForData = classpath:demo/game/assets

# Base url for pictures, relative to the base url for any data. The "{gdef}" placeholder will be replaced with the selected canvas size id.
baseUrlSpecs.baseUrlForPictures = gfx-{gdef}

# Base url for canvas-size-dependant sprites definition files, relative to the base url for any data.
baseUrlSpecs.baseUrlForSprites = sprites

# Base url for sound effects, relative to the base url for any data.
baseUrlSpecs.baseUrlForSoundEffects = sound-fx

# Base url for the music, relative to the base url for any data.
baseUrlSpecs.baseUrlForJukebox = sound-music

#### The end for now
#But there will be the list of gamelet making the game, and the top level sequence of gamelets.
